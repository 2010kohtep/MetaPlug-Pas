# MetaPas

## Summary

Example of [Metamod](https://github.com/alliedmodders/metamod-hl1) plugin, written in Pascal using Borland Delphi 7 IDE. The project is guaranteed to work on this IDE, but no tests were performed on others. You can build this project for Windows and Linux.

## Compilation

For compilation under Windows it's enough to use [Delphi 7](https://mega.nz/#!uNtFxZZZ!vfhkW5FtmMGjcPbVsFZiBhFK6MQQM7koqKg50kljELI). To compile under Linux, you will need [CrossKylix](https://crosskylix.untergrund.net/) and the Delphi 7 and [Kylix 3](https://mega.nz/#!eZsCCSzL!XGbHJCzkaCAg51eTK_lplF7jGdC8-UtKRCdVR3GkJBU) IDEs.

## Credits

The project uses the Half-Life 1 SDK, taken from the project [OpenHLDS](https://github.com/unnamed10/openhlds).
